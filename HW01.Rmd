# 1. What is the best way to contact the instructor?

# 2. Describe a resource listed in the syllabus (do not copy and paste).

# 3. When do you have to complete the assigned readings per lecture?

# 4. With the exception of the first homework, when are homeworks due?

# 5. What is the general policy regarding collaboration?

# 6. What are the different elements of the class that will be graded, and what is their percentage contribution to the total grade?

# 7. What are the two elements of the final project, and what format can they be delivered?

# 8. In your own words, describe two etiquette principles for zoom meetings.

# 9. Have you read the syllabus in its entirety and understood it?

# 10. Do you agree to abide by the principles listed in the syllabus?

# 11. Basic definitions.

Let $X$ be an exponential random variable with rate parameter $\lambda>0$.

## (a) What is the range of $X$, its PDF, and its CDF?

## (b) What is the $n^{th}$ moment of $X$?

## (c) What are the mean and variance of $X$?

## (d) Let $\epsilon >0$. What should $a$ be so that $(P(X > a) = \epsilon$?

# 12. Transformations of random variables.

Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be i.i.d. exponential random variables with parameter $\lambda$. Let $(Y,Z) = T(X_1, X_2)$, where $T: D \rightarrow R$ is the transformation.

\[T(x, x') := (x + x', x - x')\]

## (a) What is the joint PDF of $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$?

## (b) What is the domain $D$ of $T$?

## (c) What is the inverse transformation of $T^{-1}$, and its Jacobian determinant?

## (d) What is the range $R$ of $T$?

## (e) What is the joint PDF of $Y$ and $Z$? Provide the support also.

## (f) What are the marginal PDFs of $Y$ and $Z$?

# 13. Important Theorems

State the following.

## (a) The Central Limit Theorem

## (b) The Weak Law of Large Numbers

# 14. MLE

Suppose that $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ are i.i.d. random variables with PDF:

\[f_x(x) = \frac{x}{a}exp\{\frac{-x^2}{2a}\}, x \geq 0\]

## (a) Find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter a.

## (b) Find the Fisher Information of $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ and use it to estimate a 95% confidence interval on the MLE of a.

## (c) Explain how the central limit theorem relates to the previous quesiton.

# 15. Good 'ol Bayes.

A lab blood test is 95% effective in detecting a certain disease when the disease is present. However, if a healthy individual is tested, there is a 1% chance that the test result will imply that this individual has the disease. If it is known that 5% of the population have the disease, what is the probability that a person has the disease, given that the test says they do?
